Arduino is a platform and an environment. It's a collection of small microcontroller boards which 
contain small bits of code. This allows it to interact with an Arduino IDE. The Arduino Uno is the most popular as
it contains an ATmega328 chip running at 16 Mhz with digital and analog pins.


void setup () - This code runs once where it initialises all the inputs and outputs that are needed for the project.
void loop() - This code runs repeatedly keeping the same sequence as provided.

Week 1 Project (BLINK)

int LED = 6; //connecting variable named LED to digital Pin 6.

void setup () { // This is used to initialise the pins that are needed for the project.
pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // This is used to set the LED pin as an output.
}

void loop ()  { // This void applies the initialised code to create a sequence and activates the code.

digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // This turns the led on.
delay(1000); // This allows to leave the light on for 1s.
digitalWrite(LED ,LOW); // this turns them off.
delay(1000); // This ensures their off for 1s
}

Project 2 (LED button Control)

int LED = 6; // Connects the digital pin 6 to a global variable.
int Button = 10; //  // Connects the digital pin 10 to a global variable.
int ButtonState; // The variable is used to control the state of the button.

void setup () {
pinMode(LED , OUTPUT); // initialises the pin as an output for the led.
pinMode(Button, INPUT_PULLUP); // initialises the pin as an input for the button and input pull-up removes the need for the addition of a resistor since ardunio contains an internal resistor.
}

void loop () {
ButtonState = digitalRead(Button); // This connects the button signal to a variable named ButtonState.
if(ButtonState == HIGH){ // the if loop sets the actions that occur when the button is pressed or not.
digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
}else{
digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
}
}
